## About

## Setup

### Moving files to pi

Moving the files from this repo to the rpi is easy. A file named `setup.sh` has been setup
to automatically move the files into the home directory of the rpi. By running `./setup.sh`
the script will print out all of the use cases. This program can be setup by using the 
following

```
./setup.sh -u USERNAME -a 192.168.1.0 
```

This will copy the files over and generate a file named `pi_connect.sh`. Each time there
is a  need to connect to rpi, running the script `./pi_connect.sh` will automatically connect
to the rpi and change directory to the project.

### Turning on SPI

To check to see if SPI is enables alread run:

```
lsmod | grep spi_
```

First check to see if there are any 
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Edit the system file by:

```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt 
```

or

```
sudo vim /boot/config.txt 
```


Find the line `dtparam=spi=` and change it to:
```
dtparam=spi=on
```

If `dtparam=spi=` doesn't exist, add it at the bottom. Reboot the device to 
reflect the new change:

```
sudo reboot
```

### Hardware setup

![alt text](https://github.com/timothypholmes/icestick-counter/blob/main/wires.png)

The icestick pins that are used are shown below.

```
                     ----------
                     | 3V3  3V3 |
                     | GND  GND |
                     | 91    81 |
                     | 90    80 |              
                     | 88    79 |              
                     | 87    78 | <            
                     ----------   
```

The Raspberry-pi has will display pinouts using the command `pinout`. This is shown below as well.

```
                  3V3  (1) (2)  5V    
                GPIO2  (3) (4)  5V    
                GPIO3  (5) (6)  GND   
                GPIO4  (7) (8)  GPIO14
                  GND  (9) (10) GPIO15
               GPIO17 (11) (12) GPIO18
               GPIO27 (13) (14) GND   
               GPIO22 (15) (16) GPIO23
                  3V3 (17) (18) GPIO24
               GPIO10 (19) (20) GND   
                GPIO9 (21) (22) GPIO25
               GPIO11 (23) (24) GPIO8 
                  GND (25) (26) GPIO7 
                GPIO0 (27) (28) GPIO1 
                GPIO5 (29) (30) GND   
                GPIO6 (31) (32) GPIO12
               GPIO13 (33) (34) GND   
               GPIO19 (35) (36) GPIO16
               GPIO26 (37) (38) GPIO20
                  GND (39) (40) GPIO21
```

The following icestick pins connect to the following RPI pins

```
Type    FPGA Pin    RPI Pin            Wire from img
----------------------------------------------------
MOSI -> Pin 88      -> GPIO Pin (19)   (White)
MISO -> Pin 90      -> GPIO Pin (21)   (Red)
SCLK -> Pin 91      -> GPIO Pin (23)   (Blue)
CE0  -> Pin 81      -> GPIO Pin (24)   (Yellow)
```

### Compiling Icestick

Within the repo change directories on the machine that the icestick is connected to:

```
cd ./icestick
```

run the command `make upload` and now the icestick is ready!


### Running count program

Within the repo change directories on the raspberry-pi to:

```
cd ./rpi
```

run the command `make`, this will compile the programe with the appropriate library. Then
run `./counter` to start the program.


## Demo

Within the repo

`cd rpi`

and run the command

`./counter`

to run the program that uses the library wiringpi. Use the command 

`sudo ./counter_pigpio`

to run the program that uses the library pigpio. NOTE: the use of sudo. The program will not initilize the GPIO without the use of sudo.

cd icestorm
make -j$(nproc)
make install
```

make install
```

### Yosys

On mac edit the Makefile and edit the first few lines as:

```
